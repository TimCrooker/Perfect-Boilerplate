### Overview

Perfect-Boilerplate is the best way to get started building any web application. Go from idea to production in minutes without touching config files or worrying about your project structure and dependencies

Our powerful CLI can build anything... From a small front-end applet to a production-ready Full-Stack SaaS application and anything in between. No matter which parts of your application it's used for, you are guaranteed industry-standard best practices and an effortless development experience out-of-the-box

Perfect-Boilerplate supports the most popular frameworks and technologies allowing you to choose exactly which frameworks and technologies you want, significantly reducing dependency bloat.

## Boilerplates

The popularity of javascript web applications has exploded in the last few years and with it, so has the number of powerful frameworks you can use to build them. Each framework has seemingly infinite packages available to do anything you can imagine. From those that perform the most fundamental functions of an application like state-management, routing, and HTTP requests to developer packages for things like linting, testing, and transpilation, it's easy to become overwhelmed.

Luckily many popular frameworks have a boilerplate that establishes config files and gets you ready to start building. One of the most popular of these is CRA(Create-React-App) for the React framework. These are great tools to use for demonstration purposes or for learning how to use the frameworks. It takes mere seconds to get started and they are pre-built with many useful scripts to speed up development and deployment. 

Unfortunately, when it comes to building applications for the real world, these boilerplates are lacking 

Currently, there are quite a few useful boilerplates available that have both the front end and back end code that is ready-to-go with maybe even some pre-built features like user authentication or payments. With the large variety of projects from so many different years and with each one having a different set of features, dependencies, stylings, APIs, documentation, and general code quality, it can be very difficult to pick one. Not to mention the risk involved with committing to a boilerplate and beginning development only to find out that it's riddled with technical debt and incompatible with things you want to add.
